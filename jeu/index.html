      <p class="indent">A long time ago, when not all the stars were shining in the sky, lived two young children. They came from a little and isolated village lost between the mountains and some valleys.</p>
      <p class="margin">The children were always happy to live here with their family and friends, because this village was special. In the village everyone received a companion at their birth and the two children were no exception. The oldest received a magpie while the youngest received a spider. They loved dearly their companions and did everything with them. Even if their life was sometimes monotone, they never felt the need to leave.</p>
      <p class="indent">One night, while everyone was sleeping, something unusual happened. A couple and their companions had disappeared without a word. It was the first time that someone left the village. The children were very sad because the couple had always be so kind to them and they were going to miss them. </p>
      <p class="margin">Their parents reassured them: one day, even the children would leave the village too, they will be all grown up. To this day, more and more disappearances happened until the family remained alone in a ghost village, but their parents were always reassuring them. 
        Unfortunately, the inevitable happened. Their parents disappeared too.</p>
